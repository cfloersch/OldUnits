Provides strongly typed measurements to enforce compile-time
check of parameters consistency and avoid interface errors.
<p/>
Let's take the following example:
<pre>
   class Person {
      void setWeight(double weight);
   }
</pre>
<p/>
Should the weight be in pound, kilogram, other ??<br>
Using measures there is no room for error:
<p/>
<pre>
  class Person {
    void setWeight(Measurable&lt;Mass&gt; weight);
  }
</pre>
<p/>
Not only is the interface cleaner (the weight has to be of mass type);
but also there is no confusion on the measurement unit as the user can
specify the value in any unit of mass:
<p/>
<pre>
   BigDecimal weightInKg = weight.getValue(KILOGRAM);
   BigDecimal weightInLb = weight.getValue(POUND);
</pre>
<p/>
Measurable work hand-in-hand with units (also parameterized).
For example, the following would result in compile-time error:
<p/>
<pre>
   // Compile error, Unit&lt;Mass&gt; required.
   BigDecimal weightInLiter = weight.getValue(LITER);
</pre>
