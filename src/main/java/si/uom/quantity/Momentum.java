/**
 * In Newtonian mechanics, linear momentum, translational momentum, or simply momentum (pl. momenta) is the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It is a vector quantity, possessing a magnitude and a direction. If m is an object's mass and v is its velocity (also a vector quantity), then the object's momentum is:
<code>\mathbf{p} = m \mathbf{v}</code>.<br>
 * In SI units, momentum is measured in kilogram meters per second (kgâ‹…m/s).
